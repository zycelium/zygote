Zygote: Personal Automation Framework


## What is Zycelium Zygote?

The Zycelium Project aims to build a connect-everything network 
made by and for privacy-minded, security-aware, python-literate
individuals.

Zygote is an automation system to create and run personal agents.

Agents are code that interfaces with the world outside Zygote 
and provides APIs that the owner of an instance can use to 
automate pretty much anything as long as there's an agent for it.

Zygote does not restrict itself to IoT or home automation,
you can automate online APIs, apps running on your machines,
create a chatbot for yourself, scrape the web, 
ssh into your machines and perform tasksâ€¦ you get the idea,
all you need is (someone/you) to write Python code to make it so.

## How far along is the project?

As of now, it is in the prototyping stage.

I am exploring various Python libraries to write code that is 
easy to read and understand in a weekend or two.
I find this part necessary to trust the framework that will
have a complete view of my entire life.

As of now, writing agents that pull information from APIs
and post to other APIs is possible.
Another agent can patch the events coming from one agent 
to another.

The format of each event is not fixed yet.


## I want to try it out!

Be warned that this is very much a work in progress
and things break all the time.
If you are okay with that, welcome aboard!


### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/zycelium/zygote.git
cd zygote
poetry install
poetry run zygote serve
```

If you don't have `poetry` installed, get it with `python3 -m pip install poetry`

Once running, you can access the WebUI at https://localhost:3965/


Zygote has a few built-in agents and some that you can install as you need.
Built in and installed agents are provisioned in the database automatically.
To install extra agents, find them in the `agents` directory in the project root.

Example:

```
poetry shell
cd agents/openweather
pip install -e .
```

### Using Zygote


In the WebUI


- Create a Space named "home"
- Go to the Agents page to see all available agents
- Click on each agent name to open Agent page
  - Join "home" space
  - In the Update section, configure agents if they require API keys.
- Stop the server with Ctrl+C
- Run it again
- Watch your personal automation system do its thing

The above list of steps is merely a workaround for missing features
such as reloading agents upon configuration changes. 
Please note, this is a work in progress.
